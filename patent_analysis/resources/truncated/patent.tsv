"10000000"	"utility"	"10000000"	"US"	"2018-06-19"	"A frequency modulated (coherent) laser detection and ranging system includes a read-out integrated circuit formed with a two-dimensional array of detector elements each including a photosensitive region receiving both return light reflected from a target and light from a local oscillator, and local processing circuitry sampling the output of the photosensitive region four times during each sample period clock cycle to obtain quadrature components. A data bus coupled to one or more outputs of each of the detector elements receives the quadrature components from each of the detector elements for each sample period and serializes the received quadrature components. A processor coupled to the data bus receives the serialized quadrature components and determines an amplitude and a phase for at least one interfering frequency corresponding to interference between the return light and the local oscillator light using the quadrature components."

The surround (4) comprises a structure behind which parts of the container wall (1) extend and/or which is penetrated by said parts. The method is carried out using a multi-part blow mold that has at least two mold parts, each having at least one cavity, wherein the surround is placed as an insert in the cavity (10) of the blow mold (7). The method comprises pressing the preform that has been forced into the cavity (10) into the structure of the surround (4) by means of a tool which is brought to bear on the preform (12) on the side of the preform facing away from the cavity (10)."

"10000005"	"utility"	"10000005"	"US"	"2018-06-19"	"A vacuum forming apparatus is provided that forms an article having a covering bonded to the surface of a substrate in a molding space using a first mold and a second mold. The vacuum forming apparatus is provided with clamps for grasping the covering between the first and second molds arranged at the open positions. The clamps are movable between an interfering position, at which the clamps are located in the movement ranges of the first and second molds, and standby positions, at which the clamps are outside the movement ranges. After the covering is heated, the clamps grasping the covering move to the standby positions and stretch the covering. The first and second molds move to the closed positions and the article is molded between the first and second molds so that the stretched covering and the substrate are bonded to each other."
